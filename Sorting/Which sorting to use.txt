Insertion Sort:
    - Use when only few items or small input or nearly sorted input.
    - In that case its really fast and uses very little space and is easily implemented

Bubble Sort and Selection Sort:
    - You are never going to use bubble sort honestly.
    - Its just there for understanding sorts.

Merge Sort:
    - Really good because of divide and conquer.
    - If you are ever worried about worst case scenario, use merge sort.
    - But if you are worried about memory or space complexity then merge sort is expensive to use.
    - o(n) space complexity
    - if you have external space, then merge sort is really good.

Quick Sort:
    - Better than merge sort in terms of both space and time complexity.
    - But just the worst case for time complexity is 0(n^2).
    - Its probably the most popular one.
