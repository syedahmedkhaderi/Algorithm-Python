What is Selection Sort?
	•	Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
	•	The algorithm works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element 
    •   from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the beginning.
	•	This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Time Complexity:
	•	Worst Case: O(n²)
	•	Average Case: O(n²)
	•	Best Case: O(n²)
	•	Regardless of array state, Selection Sort always performs the same number of comparisons 
    •   because it must scan through the unsorted portion to find the minimum each time.
    
How it Works (Step by Step):
	1.	Divide the array into two parts: sorted and unsorted.
	2.	Find the smallest element in the unsorted part.
	3.	Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
	4.	Now the sorted part grows, and the unsorted part shrinks.
	5.	Repeat until the array is sorted.
