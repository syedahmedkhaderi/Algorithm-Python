What is Merge Sort?
	•	Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
	•	It works by recursively dividing the array into halves until each subarray contains a single element.
	•	Then, it merges these subarrays in a sorted manner to produce the final sorted array.
	•	This algorithm is stable and efficient for large datasets.

Time Complexity:
	•	Worst Case: O(n log n)
	•	Average Case: O(n log n)
	•	Best Case: O(n log n)
	•	The time complexity remains consistent because the divide and merge steps are always performed regardless of the array's initial order.

How it Works (Step by Step):
	1.	Divide the unsorted array into two halves recursively until each subarray has one element.
	2.	Merge the two halves by comparing elements from each and placing the smaller one into a new array.
	3.	Continue merging the subarrays until the entire array is merged and sorted.
	4.	The merge process ensures that the combined array is sorted.
	5.	Repeat until the full array is sorted.
