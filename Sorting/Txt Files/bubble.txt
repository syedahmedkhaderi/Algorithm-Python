What is Bubble Sort?
	•	Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms.
	•	It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements,
    •   and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
	•	The “largest” elements gradually move to the end of the list with each pass
    •   — like bubbles rising to the top.

Time Complexity:
	•	Worst Case: O(n²) → Happens when the list is in reverse order.
	•	Average Case: O(n²) → For a randomly ordered list.
	•	Best Case: O(n) → When the list is already sorted (with an optimized version).
    
Working of Bubble Sort:
	1.	Compare two adjacent items.
	2.	Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
	3.	Repeat this process for every adjacent pair in the list.
	4.	After each pass, the largest value settles at the end of the list.
	5.	Continue until the entire list is sorted.
