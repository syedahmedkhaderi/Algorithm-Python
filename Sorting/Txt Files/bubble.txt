In Bubble Sort, the largest value is bubbled up in every pass.
    -Every two adjacent items are compared 
    -and they are swapped if they are in the wrong order.
    -This way, after every pass, the largest element reaches to the end of the array.
    -Time complexity of Bubble Sort in Worst 
    -and Average Case is O(n^2) and in best case, its O(n)

There is another method of creating bubble sort which is more optimized.
    -We can optimize the bubble sort slightly by adding a new boolean variable
    -which keeps track of wehether any swaps were done in the last iteration or not
    -This way, if say halfway through the loops, 
    -the array becomes completely sorted, then we won't do unnecessary comparisons
