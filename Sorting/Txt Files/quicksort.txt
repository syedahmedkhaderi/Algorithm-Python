What is Quick Sort?
	•	Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
	•	It works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around the pivot.
	•	Elements smaller than the pivot go to the left, and larger ones to the right.
	•	It then recursively sorts the subarrays on either side of the pivot.

Time Complexity:
	•	Worst Case: O(n²) → Occurs when the pivot is poorly chosen, like in a sorted or reverse-sorted array.
	•	Average Case: O(n log n) → For randomly ordered arrays with a good pivot.
	•	Best Case: O(n log n) → When the pivot consistently divides the array evenly.
    
How it Works (Step by Step):
	1.	Choose a pivot element from the array.
	2.	Partition the array so that elements less than the pivot are on the left and greater on the right.
	3.	Recursively apply Quick Sort to the left subarray.
	4.	Recursively apply Quick Sort to the right subarray.
	5.	Continue until the base case is reached (subarrays of size 1), resulting in a sorted array.
