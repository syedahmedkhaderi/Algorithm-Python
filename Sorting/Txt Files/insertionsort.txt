What is Insertion Sort?
	•	Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
	•	It builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
	•	The algorithm works by taking elements from the unsorted portion and inserting them into their correct position in the sorted portion.
	•	This process is efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted arrays.

Time Complexity:
	•	Worst Case: O(n²)
	•	Average Case: O(n²)
	•	Best Case: O(n)
	•	It performs fewer comparisons when the array is already partially sorted, making the best case O(n).

How it Works (Step by Step):
	1.	Consider the first element as the initial sorted portion.
	2.	Take the next element from the unsorted portion.
	3.	Compare it with the elements in the sorted portion, starting from the right.
	4.	Shift all larger elements in the sorted portion one position to the right to make space.
	5.	Insert the element into its correct position.
	6.	Repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.
