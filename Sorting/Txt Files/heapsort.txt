What is Heap Sort?
	•	Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.
	•	It first builds a max-heap from the input array.
	•	Then, it repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the array.
	•	This process continues until the array is sorted.

Time Complexity:
	•	Worst Case: O(n log n)
	•	Average Case: O(n log n)
	•	Best Case: O(n log n)
	•	The complexity is consistent due to the heap operations, which are logarithmic in nature.

How it Works (Step by Step):
	1.	Build a max-heap from the input array.
	2.	Swap the root (maximum element) with the last element of the heap.
	3.	Reduce the heap size by one and heapify the root to maintain the heap property.
	4.	Repeat the extraction and heapify process for the remaining elements.
	5.	Continue until the heap is empty and the array is fully sorted.
