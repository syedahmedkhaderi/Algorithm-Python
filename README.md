## Contents

### Dynamic Programming
- Foundational material and Python scripts for dynamic programming concepts and comparisons.

### Recursion
- Recursive algorithm implementations and explanations.

### Searching + BFS + DFS
- Linear and graph search algorithms, with visual resources included.

### Sorting
- Multiple sorting algorithms implemented in Python.
- Comparative text files discussing stability and appropriate usage of different sorting techniques.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired folder.
3. Execute Python scripts directly for algorithm demonstrations.
4. Refer to `.txt` files for theory, interview material, and comparative explanations.

## Contributing

- Follow consistent naming conventions as in the current structure.
- Add implementations in separate, appropriately named files.
- Include explanations, comments, or text files wherever necessary for clarity.
- Ensure all code is written in Python and covers canonical algorithmic paradigms.
